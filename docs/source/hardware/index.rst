Hardware Selection & Build Instructions
====================================

Although building an ESP8266-based BrewPi controller is easy with all of the hardware options out there deciding how to
approach a build can be a daunting task. This documentation will help with planning and completing your build.

Before you begin acquiring hardware, there are three key decisions that you need to make:

1. How do you want to connect your temperature sensors to the rest of your build?
2. What PCB (if any) do you want to use to connect all the components?
3. How do you want to enclose your build?

The answers to these
